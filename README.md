## Key Features

- This website displays the Current weather and 6-day forecast which is recived from OpenWeather API.

- It also equips a map which is built  with the help of leaflet and react-leaflet.

- Easy to use Website, the use of bootstrap made this website a lot more beautiful and responsive.

- Its a single page site which gives a good user experience. I does not load the whole page instead just the new data is mounted on the same site.

- A searchbar is there to load the information of any required city.

- The geocode Rapid API provides the necessary longitudes and latitudes of any city that we search for.

## My process

### Built with

- React
- Bootstrap
- React Query
- React Router
- React Hook Form
- Styled Components
- react-leaflet
- leaflet
- Openweather API
- GeoCode Rapid API

### What I Learned

- **React Fundamentals:** I gained a solid understanding of React, including components, state management, and routing, allowing me to build dynamic user interfaces.

- **Responsive UI Design:** Styled Components were used to create responsive and visually appealing user interfaces that adapt to various screen sizes.

- **Integrating with Map** Leaflet provided a easy and flexible way to integrate a map through which this site is able to load different layers for the map.

- **Compound Component Pattern:** I implemented the Compound Component Pattern to create cohesive and reusable component groups, improving the organization and maintainability of the code.

- **Working with APIs:** I used two APIs in this project which gave me the exposure to the way of working of APIs

- **Git Version Control:** I practiced effective version control using Git, allowing for code management, and tracking project changes.

- **Project Planning and Management:** I gained experience in planning and managing a large-scale project, including feature development, bug fixing, and testing.

By building "NEWS Monkey" project with these technologies and concepts, I've developed a comprehensive set of skills and knowledge that can be applied to future projects and real-world scenarios. This experience has not only expanded my technical expertise but also improved my problem-solving capabilities.
